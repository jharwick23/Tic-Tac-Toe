- Small little game project attempting to learn how to create a cpu for player to play against and learn opengl.

1. Create AI that is beatable yet smart

       **Prioritize Winning Moves:** The AI should check if there is a move that allows it to win on the current turn. If such a move exists, the AI should make that move. (Finished)

       **Block User Wins:** If the user is one move away from winning, the AI should prioritize blocking that winning move. (Finished)

       **Center and Corners:** The center and corners are generally strong positions. The AI can prioritize occupying these positions early in the game. (Finished)

2. Create Graphics for Tic Tac Toe Game using Open GL.
